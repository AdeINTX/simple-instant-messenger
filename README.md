# simple-instant-messenger
This simple instant messenger is actually originated from a Java Intermediate Tutorial from a YouTube channel: thenewboston. In addition, this is still a simple messenger. The program is still tested in the localhost (that is, both client and server testings are done in the same computer). I have planned some future updates: testing the program in two different computers (one for server, another for the client), improving the UI (the background color, design), adding more features (multi-languages, clear window button, time and date), and maybe adding more complex programs such as chatbots, stickers, etc. The detailed description about this program will be available soon (the description in Indonesian will be written in my personal blog www.the-elysiana.blogspot.com)
